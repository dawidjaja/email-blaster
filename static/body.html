<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Sir/Madam,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good day to you!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am Daniel Alfred Widjaja, Marketing Executive of NUSSU Committee of Information and Technology (commIT).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of the CharITeach 2019 Organizing Committee, I am writing to propose a partnership with <strong>%COMPANY_NAME%</strong> for CharITeach 2019!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CharITeach is a charity event whereby young NUS undergraduates will have the opportunity to impart their knowledge to underprivileged kids related to programming skills. Children will be introduced to <strong>Scratch</strong>, a user-friendly platform designed by MIT for children to learn programming in a fun and interactive manner. We aim to equip these children with basic programming skills, which will be highly relevant and useful in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CharITeach 2019 will be held on </span><strong>30th March 2019</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and we expect </span><strong>90 participants, 55 volunteers and 20 management committees</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year. We would appreciate if your company can contribute to the success of this event again through sponsorship of:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1) Product Sponsorship for goodie bag items (165 units);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2) Cash Sponsorship;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(3) Product Prizes for Lucky Draw and Design Competition </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In return, we will provide an extensive range of publicity avenues - websites, posters, shout-out during the event and social media platform as well as potential future collaborations - which will lead to </span><strong>heightened brand awareness</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among NUS community. On top of that, your company may also have a exclusive presentation subjecting to the fulfillment of the partnership requirements. We have received positive feedback from our previous partners and would like to extend this opportunity to <strong>%COMPANY_NAME%</strong> this year. Please refer to the </span><strong>attached proposal</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for further details.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sincerely hope that you would consider our proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</span></p>
